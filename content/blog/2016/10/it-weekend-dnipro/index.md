Next week, I’ll be at Dnipro, Ukraine. Currently, I am preparing for my talk which is about _Mobile Websites_. With this talk, we are going to discuss history and future of web development.

This event will be held on 22nd of October at Dnipro, Ukraine. Today, I was at the racecourse and wanted to record a video for you.

Don’t forget to check the agenda and register for the event.

I hope that my friends who are living at Lviv won’t get angry with me because I missed the latest DevFest in Ukraine and now traveling to Dnipro.
